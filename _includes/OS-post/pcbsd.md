### Background
{% include OS-post/os.html os="PC-BSD" url="http://www.pcbsd.org/" forum="https://forums.pcbsd.org/" wiki="http://wiki.pcbsd.org/index.php/Main_Page" wp="PC-BSD" ircs="pcbsd" ml="http://lists.pcbsd.org/mailman/listinfo" d="http://www.pcbsd.org/en/download.html" dw="pcbsd" docs="http://www.pcbsd.org/en/documentation/" %} is a free and open-source desktop-oriented [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) derivative. It is built on the latest release of FreeBSD and has some graphical tools to aid in the installation and usage of the system. The default desktop environment of PC-BSD is KDE Plasma 4 (KDE Plasma 5 is still not available on it, as of {{ page.date | date: "%d %B %y" }}, see [this forum post](https://forums.freebsd.org/threads/kde-plasma-5.47280/) for details).

You may have noticed this is the only BSD derivative compared in this post, this is because while I have tried FreeBSD and [GhostBSD](http://ghostbsd.org/) only PC-BSD I have used enough to be able to review. FreeBSD itself is, by default, a command-line operating system with no graphical installers or GUIs. GUIs can be installed by those with the know-how and inclination to, but they are not included by default. I have tried to install GUIs on FreeBSD 10.2, including KDE Plasma 4, but it failed to load. GhostBSD, on the other hand, has the problem of being based on the second-latest release of FreeBSD (e.g., as of {{ page.date | date: "%d %B %y" }}, the latest release of GhostBSD is based on FreeBSD 10.1 and FreeBSD 10.2 is presently available).

FreeBSD is currently ranked at 27th on the *DistroWatch* website for popularity amongst the &#42;nix operating systems it ranks, while PC-BSD is ranked 43rd and GhostBSD is ranked 68th.
