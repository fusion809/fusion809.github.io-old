### Background
{% include OS-post/os.html os="Sabayon Linux" url="http://www.sabayon.org/" docs="https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=En:Main_Page" forum="https://forum.sabayon.org/" ircs="sabayon" ml="https://lists.sabayon.org/mailman/listinfo" bugs="https://bugs.sabayon.org/" wiki="https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=En:Main_Page" gr="Sabayon" dw="sabayon" %} is an Italian Linux distribution that is based on Gentoo and is designed to be more beginner-friendly and out-of-the-box than its parent distribution. It features its own binary package manager called [**Entropy**](https://wiki.sabayon.org/index.php?title=En:Entropy) ([`equo`](/man/equo.1.html) from the command-line and its Rigo graphical front-end), although it also has the Portage package manager of Gentoo available for use by more advanced users. Additionally it uses Calamares as its graphical installer (although up until September 2015 it used the Anaconda installer of Fedora instead), as opposed to Gentoo which must be manually installed by the user, following steps outlined at the Gentoo Wiki.

It was first founded in 2005 by Fabio Erculiani, an Italian software engineer and it is now maintained by a team of less than 20 developers (this number is based on the number of people in the {% include irc.html irc="#sabayon-dev" %} IRC channel, if anyone is wanting to know my sources), including Erculiani. Now what Erculiani mostly does for Sabayon, from what I can tell (as after all I am not a Sabayon developer so I do not know what happens behind the scenes), is he develops official kernel images for Sabayon and the Entropy package manager which both have ebuilds in the [`sabayon-distro`](https://github.com/Sabayon/sabayon-distro) Portage overlay. Two additional people work on maintaining the Entropy repositories, although until recently a bot was being used to do much of this maintenance and a total of eight people have write access to Sabayon's GitHub repositories (which includes Erculiani and one of the two Entropy repository maintainers, Joost Ruis).

Currently it is ranked 32nd for popularity according to the *DistroWatch* website, although it is worthwhile noting that between 2007 and 2010 it managed to appear in the top 10 list of *DistroWatch* in terms of its popularity.

### Package Management
As previously mentioned Sabayon uses both Entropy and Portage package managers, with Entropy being the only one that is officially supported by the Sabayon community. In other words, from what I can tell, if you use Portage you are on your own as far as the Sabayon community is concerned. Entropy uses binary packages compiled using Portage (and converted from Portage to Entropy packages using the command `sudo equo pkg inflate <PACKAGE>`) and like Portage it is written in Python and Bash script.
