### Ratings

* **Beginner-friendliness**: &leq;3.
* **Customizability**: &geq;9.
* **Documentation**: &geq;8. Some of the best documentation around, most of which is present at the Gentoo Wiki, while more complicated developer-type documentation (like writing ebuilds) can be found {% include link.html url="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/" link="here" %}. Most Gentoo ebuilds for complex programs (that actually need documentation, as they are not self-explanatory) also have USE flags that can be used to build documentation for the program.
* **Free support**: ? Only used the support forums for Gentoo {% include link.html url="https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1030778.html" link="once" %} and I was asking for support with using Portage on Sabayon. This one time it was not particularly helpful. I have also used the IRC channel {% include irc.html channel="gentoo-dev-help" %} twice for help writing some ebuilds and both times they were very helpful with the problem being solved within an hour of asking there.
* **Package management**: &lt;8. I like Portage on ideological grounds, but on practical grounds it is virtually impossible to use, effectively, long-term, due to the upgrade issue I mentioned under Package Management.
* **Performance/<abbr title="System Resource Usage">SRU</abbr>**: 8. Low system resource requirements, true, but high CPU/RAM use when Portage is run.
* **Stability**: ~7-10.
* **<abbr title="My Experience With It (MEWI), a numerical estimate as to how much experience I have with this system">MEWI</abbr>**: &leq;4. Given up due to the <code>emup</code> issues I mentioned.
* **Overall**: &leq;6. Ideologically I love Gentoo, but as I said Portage can be a nightmare.
