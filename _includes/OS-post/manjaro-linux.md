### Background
{% include OS-post/os.html os="Manjaro Linux" url="https://manjaro.github.io" wp="Manjaro Linux" wiki="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" forum="https://forum.manjaro.org/" ml="https://lists.manjaro.org/mailman/listinfo" irc="irc://irc.freenode.net/#manjaro" dw="manjaro" gr="manjaro" docs="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" d="http://manjaro.github.io/download/" %} is a European beginner-friendly Arch Linux-derived Linux distribution that features a graphical installer (called [Calamares](https://calamares.io)), automatic hardware detection (using the [Manjaro Hardware Detection](https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Manjaro_Hardware_Detection) tool) and several official and unofficial (or community) editions that differ only in their preinstalled desktop environment. Such official editions include KDE, NET and Xfce editions. Currently Manjaro is still in beta testing, without any official releases being made yet. I have noticed more bugs in than there are in Arch Linux, for example, I have found it impossible to run the [Deepin Desktop Environment](https://github.com/fasheng/arch-deepin/issues/92) on Manjaro, although running it on Arch Linux goes without a hitch.

Like its parent it uses pacman and Yaourt for command-line package management, although graphical front-ends also come preinstalled, including [Octopi](https://octopiproject.wordpress.com/).

openSUSE is currently the fourth most popular Linux distribution, according to *DistroWatch*.
