### Background
{% include OS-post/os.md os="Ubuntu" url="http://www.ubuntu.com/" wiki="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/" docs="https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/index.html" forum="http://ubuntuforums.org/" ask="http://askubuntu.com" bugs="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bugs" dw="ubuntu" d="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop" gr="Ubuntu" wp="Ubuntu_(operating_system)" ml="https://lists.ubuntu.com/" ircs="ubuntu-desktop" %} is a Debian-based Linux distribution developed by both [Canonical Ltd.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_(company)) (a UK-based company owned by South African entrepreneur, Mark Shuttleworth) and its own FOSS community. Most of its development occurs at [launchpad.net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchpad_(website)), a website owned and founded by Canonical.

It shares many features in common with its parent distribution, including its focus on stability over bleeding-edge software, its fixed release model, its package management systems and the fact it is free for end-users. What distinguishes it from Debian are the odd program designed specifically for Ubuntu (e.g., the Ubuntu Software Center and the Unity user interface) and its greater focus on beginner-friendliness than on customizability. It is also unique in the Linux community in that it has both Long-Term Support (LTS) releases (which are officially supported for 5 years after they are initially released) and non-LTS releases (supported only for nine months). It was also the first Linux distribution, that I am aware of, to use dated release versions. See the release version numbers used are in the format `YY.MM`, where `YY` is the last two digits of the year (e.g., 15 for 2015) and MM are the two digits of the month (e.g., 04 for April), the release was made. For example, in October 2015 the 15.10 release of Ubuntu was made (which is codenamed Wily Werewolf).
