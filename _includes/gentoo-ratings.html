  <li><b>Beginner-friendliness</b>: &leq;3.</li>
  <li><b>Customizability</b>: &geq;9.</li>
  <li><b>Documentation</b>: &geq;8. Some of the best documentation around, most of which is present at the Gentoo Wiki, while more complicated developer-type documentation (like writing ebuilds) can be found {% include link.html url="https://devmanual.gentoo.org/" link="here" %}. Most Gentoo ebuilds for complex programs (that actually need documentation, as they are not self-explanatory) also have USE flags that can be used to build documentation for the program.</li>
  <li><b>Free support</b>: ? Only used the support forums for Gentoo {% include link.html url="https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1030778.html" link="once" %} and I was asking for support with using Portage on Sabayon. This one time it was not particularly helpful. I have also used the IRC channel {% include irc.html channel="gentoo-dev-help" %} once for helping with ebuilds and they were helpful.</li>
  <li><b>Package management</b>: &lt;8. I like Portage on ideological grounds, but on practical grounds it is virtually impossible to use, effectively, long-term, due to the upgrade issue I mentioned under Package Management.</li>
  <li><b>Performance/<abbr title="System Resource Usage">SRU</abbr></b>: 8. Low system resource requirements, true, but high CPU/RAM use when Portage is run.</li>
  <li><b>Stability</b>: ~7-10.</li>
  <li><b><abbr title="My Experience With It (MEWI), a numerical estimate as to how much experience I have with this system">MEWI</abbr></b>: &leq;4. Given up due to the <code>emup</code> issues I mentioned.</li>
  <li><b>Overall</b>: &leq;6. Ideologically I love Gentoo, but as I said Portage can be a nightmare.</li>
