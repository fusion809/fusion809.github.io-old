My journey through the world of Linux began in mid 2012, when I first tried [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) 12.04 as a dual-boot with Windows 7 on my Dell laptop. At first, I must admit I was not impressed, as it was like I had landed on an alien planet, as I had never had any need to use a terminal emulator (or command-prompt as it is called under Microsoft Windows) before. Fortunately, I persevered and after a while I became almost addicted to Linux. A couple of years later I decided to delete the Windows 7 partition on my Dell laptop and make the laptop 100% pure Linux. Since then, I have never regretted making the transition to Linux. Although, I eventually outgrew Ubuntu as it was essential preschool with so much hand-holding that I was left out of many of the important decisions about my own system.
