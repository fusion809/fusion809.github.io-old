<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>emerge</b>
is the definitive command&minus;line interface to the
Portage system. It is primarily used for installing
packages, and <b>emerge</b> can automatically handle any
dependencies that the desired package has. <b>emerge</b> can
also update the <b>portage tree</b>, making new and updated
packages available. <b>emerge</b> gracefully handles
updating installed packages to newer releases as well. It
handles both source and binary packages, and it can be used
to create binary packages for distribution.</p>

<h2>EBUILDS, TBZ2S, SETS AND ATOMS
<a name="EBUILDS, TBZ2S, SETS AND ATOMS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>emerge</b>
primarily installs packages. You can specify packages to
install in five possible ways: an <i>atom</i>, a <i>set</i>,
an installed <i>file</i>, an <i>ebuild</i>, or a
<i>tbz2file</i>.</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="9%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em"><b>ebuild</b></p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">An <i>ebuild</i> must be, at a
minimum, a valid Portage package directory name without a
version or category, such as <b>portage</b> or
<b>python</b>. Both categories and version numbers may be
used in addition, such as <b>sys&minus;apps/portage</b> or
<b>=python&minus;2.2.1&minus;r2</b>. <b>emerge</b> ignores a
trailing slash so that filename completion can be used. The
<i>ebuild</i> may also be an actual filename, such as
<b>/usr/portage/app&minus;admin/python/python&minus;2.2.1&minus;r2.ebuild</b>.
<b>WARNING:</b> The implementation of <b>emerge
/path/to/ebuild</b> is broken and so this syntax
shouldn&rsquo;t be used.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>tbz2file</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A <i>tbz2file</i> must be a
valid .tbz2 created with <b>ebuild
&lt;package&gt;&minus;&lt;version&gt;.ebuild package</b> or
<b>emerge &minus;&minus;buildpkg
[category/]&lt;package&gt;</b> or <b>quickpkg
/var/db/pkg/&lt;category&gt;/&lt;package&gt;</b>.</p>

<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>file</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A <i>file</i> must be a file or directory that has been
installed by one or more packages. If an absolute path is
not used, then it must begin with either &quot;./&quot; or
&quot;../&quot;. For directories that are owned by multiple
packages, all owning packages will be selected. See the
portageq(1) owners command if you would like to query the
owners of one or more files or directories.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>set</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>A <i>set</i> is a convenient shorthand for a large group
of packages. Six sets are currently always available:
<b>selected-packages</b>, <b>selected-sets</b>,
<b>selected</b>, <b>system</b>, <b>profile</b>, and
<b>world</b>. <b>selected-packages</b> contains the
user-selected &quot;world&quot; packages that are listed in
<b>/var/lib/portage/world</b>, while <b>selected-sets</b>
contains the nested sets that may be listed in
<b>/var/lib/portage/world_sets</b>. <b>system</b> and
<b>profile</b> both refer to sets of packages deemed
necessary for your system to run properly (the differences
between these two sets are documented in <b>portage</b>(5)).
<b>selected</b> encompasses both the
<b>selected-packages</b> and <b>selected-sets</b> sets,
while <b>world</b> encompasses the <b>selected</b>,
<b>system</b> and <b>profile</b> sets. (See <b>FILES</b>
below for more information.) Other sets can exist depending
on the current configuration. The default set configuration
is located in the <b>/usr/share/portage/config/sets</b>
directory. User sets may be created by placing files in the
<b>/etc/portage/sets/</b> directory (see <b>portage</b>(5)).
Note that a <i>set</i> is generally used in conjunction with
<b>&minus;&minus;update</b>. When used as arguments to
<b>emerge</b> sets have to be prefixed with <b>@</b> to be
recognized. Use the <b>&minus;&minus;list&minus;sets</b>
action to display a list of available package sets.</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="6%">


<p><b>atom</b></p></td>
<td width="5%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>An <i>atom</i> describes bounds on a package that you
wish to install. <i>See ebuild(5) for the details on atom
syntax.</i> For example,
<b>&gt;=dev&minus;lang/python&minus;2.2.1&minus;r2</b>
matches the latest available version of Python greater than
or equal to 2.2.1&minus;r2. Similarly,
<b>&lt;dev&minus;lang/python&minus;2.0</b> matches the
latest available version of Python before 2.0. Note that in
many shells you will need to escape characters such as
&rsquo;&lt;&rsquo; and &rsquo;=&rsquo;; use single&minus; or
double&minus;quotes around the <i>atom</i> to get around
escaping problems. You may also constrain an atom to match a
specific <b>SLOT</b> by appending a colon and a <b>SLOT</b>.
Example: <b>x11&minus;libs/qt:3</b>.</p></td></tr>

<h2>ACTIONS
<a name="ACTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>No
action</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If no action is specified, the
action is to merge in the specified packages, satisfying any
dependencies that they may have. The arguments can be
<i>atoms</i>, <i>sets</i>, installed <i>files</i>,
<i>ebuilds</i>, or <i>tbz2s</i>. <b>Note that you need to
use the &minus;&minus;usepkg option if you want to install a
tbz2</b>. The packages are added to the <b>world</b> file at
the end, so that they are considered for later updating.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;check&minus;news</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Scan all repositories for
relevant unread GLEP 42 news items, and display how many are
found. See
<i>http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/glep/glep-0042.html</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cleans up the system by
examining the installed packages and removing older
packages. This is accomplished by looking at each installed
package and separating the installed versions by
<b>slot</b>. Clean will <b>remove all but the most recently
installed version in each slot</b>. Clean should not remove
unslotted packages. Note: Most recently installed means most
<b>recent</b>, not highest version.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;config</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Run package specific actions
needed to be executed after the emerge process has
completed. This usually entails configuration file setup or
other similar setups that the user may wish to run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;depclean
(-c)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Cleans the system by removing
packages that are not associated with explicitly merged
packages. Depclean works by creating the full dependency
tree from the @world set, then comparing it to installed
packages. Packages installed, but not part of the dependency
tree, will be uninstalled by depclean. See
<b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;bdeps</b> for behavior with
respect to build time dependencies that are not strictly
required. Packages that are part of the world set will
always be kept. They can be manually added to this set with
<i>emerge &minus;&minus;noreplace &lt;atom&gt;</i>. As a
safety measure, depclean will not remove any packages unless
*all* required dependencies have been resolved. As a
consequence, it is often necessary to run <i>emerge
&minus;&minus;update &minus;&minus;newuse &minus;&minus;deep
@world</i> prior to depclean. Also note that depclean may
break link level dependencies, especially when the
<b>&minus;&minus;depclean&minus;lib&minus;check</b> option
is disabled. Thus, it is recommended to use a tool such as
<b>revdep-rebuild</b>(1) in order to detect such
breakage.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING:</b>
Inexperienced users are advised to use
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> or <b>&minus;&minus;ask</b>
with this option in order to see a preview of which packages
will be uninstalled. Always study the list of packages to be
cleaned for any obvious mistakes. Note that packages listed
in package.provided (see <b>portage</b>(5)) may be removed
by depclean, even if they are part of the world set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Depclean serves
as a dependency aware version of
<b>&minus;&minus;unmerge</b>. When given one or more atoms,
it will unmerge matched packages that have no reverse
dependencies. Use <b>&minus;&minus;depclean</b> together
with <b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b> to show reverse
dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;deselect [ y |
n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Remove atoms and/or sets from
the world file. This action is implied by uninstall actions,
including <b>-&minus;depclean</b>, <b>-&minus;prune</b> and
<b>-&minus;unmerge</b>. Use <b>-&minus;deselect=n</b> in
order to prevent uninstall actions from removing atoms from
the world file.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;help</b>
(<b>&minus;h</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Displays help information for
emerge. Adding one of the additional arguments listed above
will give you more specific help information on that
subject. The internal <b>emerge</b> help documentation is
updated more frequently than this man page; check it out if
you are having problems that this man page does not help
resolve.</p>

</table>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;list&minus;sets</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Displays a list of available
package sets.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;metadata</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Transfers pregenerated metadata
cache from ${repository_location}/metadata/md5&minus;cache/
to /var/cache/edb/dep/ as is normally done on the tail end
of an rsync update using <b>emerge &minus;&minus;sync</b>.
This process populates the cache database that Portage uses
for pre-parsed lookups of package data. It does not populate
cache for repositories not distributing pregenerated
metadata cache. In order to generate cache for these
repositories, use <b>&minus;&minus;regen</b>. In versions of
portage &gt;=2.1.5 the &minus;&minus;metadata action is
totally unnecessary unless the user has enabled
FEATURES=&quot;metadata-transfer&quot; in
<b>make.conf</b>(5).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;prune</b>
(<b>&minus;P</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Removes all but the highest
installed version of a package from your system. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;prune</b> together with
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b> to show reverse dependencies or
with <b>&minus;&minus;nodeps</b> to ignore all dependencies.
<b>WARNING: This action can remove packages from your world
file! Check the emerge output of the next
&minus;&minus;depclean run carefully! Use
&minus;&minus;depclean to avoid this issue.</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;regen</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Causes portage to check and
update the dependency cache of all ebuilds in the portage
tree. The cache is used to speed up searches and the
building of dependency trees. This command is not
recommended for rsync users as rsync updates the cache using
server&minus;side caches. If you do not know the differences
between a &rsquo;rsync user&rsquo; and some other user, then
you are a &rsquo;rsync user&rsquo; :). Rsync users should
simply run <b>emerge &minus;&minus;sync</b> to regenerate
the cache. After a portage update, rsync users may find it
convenient to run <b>emerge &minus;&minus;metadata</b> to
rebuild the cache as portage does at the end of a sync
operation. In order to specify parallel
<b>&minus;&minus;regen</b> behavior, use the
<b>&minus;&minus;jobs</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;load&minus;average</b> options. If you
would like to generate and distribute cache for use by
others, use <b>egencache</b>(1).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;resume</b>(<b>&minus;r</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Resumes the most recent merge
list that has been aborted due to an error. This
re&minus;uses the arguments and options that were given with
the original command that&rsquo;s being resumed, and the
user may also provide additional options when calling
<b>&minus;&minus;resume</b>. It is an error to provide atoms
or sets as arguments to <b>&minus;&minus;resume</b>, since
the arguments from the resumed command are used instead.
Please note that this operation will only return an error on
failure. If there is nothing for portage to do, then portage
will exit with a message and a success condition. A resume
list will persist until it has been completed in entirety or
until another aborted merge list replaces it. The resume
history is capable of storing two merge lists. After one
resume list completes, it is possible to invoke
&minus;&minus;resume once again in order to resume an older
list. The resume lists are stored in
<i>/var/cache/edb/mtimedb</i>, and may be explicitly
discarded by running &lsquo;emaint &minus;&minus;fix
cleanresume&lsquo; (see <b>emaint</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;search</b>
(<b>&minus;s</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Searches for matches of the
supplied string in the portage tree. By default emerge uses
a case-insensitive simple search, but you can enable a
regular expression search by prefixing the search string
with %. For example, <b>emerge &minus;&minus;search
&quot;%^kde&quot;</b> searches for any package whose name
starts with &quot;kde&quot;; <b>emerge &minus;&minus;search
&quot;%gcc$&quot;</b> searches for any package that ends
with &quot;gcc&quot;; <b>emerge &minus;&minus;search
&quot;office&quot;</b> searches for any package that
contains the word &quot;office&quot;. If you want to include
the category into the search string, prepend an @: <b>emerge
&minus;&minus;search &quot;%@^dev-java.*jdk&quot;</b>. If
you want to search the package descriptions as well, use the
<b>&minus;&minus;searchdesc</b> action.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;searchdesc</b>
(<b>&minus;S</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Matches the search string
against the description field as well as the package name.
<b>Take caution</b> as the descriptions are also matched as
regular expressions.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE:</b>
The emerge &minus;&minus;sync command is a compatibility
command. Sync operations are now performed using the the new

(<b>&minus;C</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>WARNING: This action can

following a counter governed by <b>CLEAN_DELAY</b>. This
does no checking of dependencies, so it may remove packages
necessary for the proper operation of your system. Its

<h2>OPTIONS
<a name="OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>



<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;properties=ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option temporarily
overrides the <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> variable. The
<b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> variable is incremental, which
means that the specified setting is appended to the existing
value from your configuration. The special <b>-*</b> token
can be used to discard the existing configuration value and
start fresh. See the <b>MASKED PACKAGES</b> section and
<b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about
ACCEPT_PROPERTIES. A typical usage example for this option
would be to use
<i>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;properties=&minus;interactive</i>
to temporarily mask interactive packages. With default
configuration, this would result in an effective
<b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> value of &quot;*
-interactive&quot;.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;restrict=ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option temporarily
overrides the <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> variable. The
<b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> variable is incremental, which means
that the specified setting is appended to the existing value
from your configuration. The special <b>-*</b> token can be
used to discard the existing configuration value and start
fresh. See the <b>MASKED PACKAGES</b> section and
<b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about
ACCEPT_RESTRICT. A typical usage example for this option
would be to use
<i>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;restrict=&minus;bindist</i> to
temporarily mask packages that are not binary
re&minus;distributable. With default configuration, this
would result in an effective <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> value of
&quot;* -bindist&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;alert [ y | n
] (&minus;A short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add a terminal bell character
(&rsquo;\a&rsquo;) to all interactive prompts. This is
especially useful if dependency resolution is taking a long
time, and you want emerge to alert you when it is finished.
If you use <b>emerge -auAD world</b>, emerge will
courteously point out when it has finished calculating the
graph.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>--alert</b>
may be &rsquo;y&rsquo; or &rsquo;n&rsquo;.
&rsquo;true&rsquo; and &rsquo;false&rsquo; mean the same
thing. Using <b>--alert</b> without an option is the same as
using it with &rsquo;y&rsquo;. Try it with &rsquo;emerge -aA
portage&rsquo;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">If your
terminal emulator is set up to make &rsquo;\a&rsquo; into a
window manager urgency hint, move your cursor to a different
window to get the effect.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;alphabetical</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When displaying USE and other
flag output, combines the enabled and disabled lists into
one list and sorts the whole list alphabetically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ask [ y | n ]
(&minus;a short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Before performing the action,
display what will take place (server info for
<b>&minus;&minus;sync</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b>
output for merge, and so forth), then ask whether to proceed
with the action or abort. Using <b>&minus;&minus;ask</b> is
more efficient than using <b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> and
then executing the same command without
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b>, as dependencies will only need
to be calculated once. <b>WARNING: If the &quot;Enter&quot;
key is pressed at the prompt (with no other input), it is
interpreted as acceptance of the first choice. Note that the
input buffer is not cleared prior to the prompt, so an
accidental press of the &quot;Enter&quot; key at any time
prior to the prompt will be interpreted as a choice! Use the
&minus;&minus;ask&minus;enter&minus;invalid option if you
want a single &quot;Enter&quot; key press to be interpreted
as invalid input.</b></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ask&minus;enter&minus;invalid</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When used together with the
<b>&minus;&minus;ask</b> option, interpret a single
&quot;Enter&quot; key press as invalid input. This helps
prevent accidental acceptance of the first choice. This
option is intended to be set in the <b>make.conf</b>(5)
<b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;autounmask [ y

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Automatically unmask packages
and generate package.use settings as necessary to satisfy
dependencies. This option is enabled by default. If any
configuration changes are required, then they will be
displayed after the merge list and emerge will immediately
abort. If the displayed configuration changes are
satisfactory, you should copy and paste them into the
specified configuration file(s), or enable the
<b>&minus;&minus;autounmask&minus;write</b> option. The
<b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> variable may be used to disable
this option by default in <b>make.conf</b>(5).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;autounmask&minus;unrestricted&minus;atoms
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If &minus;&minus;autounmask is
enabled, keyword and mask changes using the &acute;=&acute;
operator will be written. With this option,
&acute;&gt;=&acute; operators will be used whenever
possible. USE and license changes always use the latter
behavior.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;autounmask&minus;keep&minus;masks
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If &minus;&minus;autounmask is
enabled, no package.unmask or ** keyword changes will be
created. This leads to unsatisfied dependencies if no other
solution exists.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;autounmask&minus;write
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If &minus;&minus;autounmask is
enabled, changes are written to config files, respecting
<b>CONFIG_PROTECT</b> and <b>&minus;&minus;ask</b>. If the
corresponding package.* is a file, the changes are appended
to it, if it is a directory, changes are written to the
lexicographically last file. This way it is always ensured
that the new changes take precedence over existing changes.
This option is automatically enabled with
&minus;&minus;ask.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;backtrack=COUNT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies an integer number of
times to backtrack if dependency calculation fails due to a
conflict or an unsatisfied dependency (default:
&acute;3&acute;).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;binpkg&minus;changed&minus;deps
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to ignore binary
packages for which the corresponding ebuild dependencies
have changed since the packages were built. In order to help
avoid issues with resolving inconsistent dependencies, this
option is automatically enabled unless the
<b>&minus;&minus;usepkgonly</b> option is enabled. Behavior
with respect to changed build&minus;time dependencies is
controlled by the <b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;bdeps</b>
option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;binpkg&minus;respect&minus;use
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to ignore binary
packages if their USE flags don&rsquo;t match the current
configuration. In order to help avoid issues with resolving
inconsistent USE flag settings, this option is automatically
enabled unless the <b>&minus;&minus;usepkgonly</b> option is
enabled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;buildpkg [ y |
n ] (&minus;b short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to build binary
packages for all ebuilds processed in addition to actually
merging the packages. Useful for maintainers or if you
administrate multiple Gentoo Linux systems (build once,
emerge tbz2s everywhere) as well as disaster recovery. The
package will be created in the <b>PKGDIR</b> directory (see
<b>make.conf</b>(5)). An alternative for
already&minus;merged packages is to use <b>quickpkg</b>(1)
which creates a tbz2 from the live filesystem.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;buildpkg&minus;exclude</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package atoms for which no binary packages should be built.
This option overrides all possible ways to enable building
of binary packages except for the downgrade&minus;backup and
unmerge&minus;backup <b>FEATURES</b> settings (see
<b>make.conf</b>(5) for more information about
<b>FEATURES</b> settings).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;buildpkgonly</b>
(<b>&minus;B</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Creates binary packages for all
ebuilds processed without actually merging the packages.
This comes with the caveat that all build-time dependencies
must already be emerged on the system.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;changed&minus;deps
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to replace
installed packages for which the corresponding ebuild
dependencies have changed since the packages were built.
This option also implies the <b>&minus;&minus;selective</b>
option. Behavior with respect to changed build&minus;time
dependencies is controlled by the
<b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;bdeps</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;changed&minus;use</b>
(<b>&minus;U</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to include
installed packages where USE flags have changed since
installation. This option also implies the
<b>&minus;&minus;selective</b> option. Unlike
<b>&minus;&minus;newuse</b>, the
<b>&minus;&minus;changed&minus;use</b> option does not
trigger reinstallation when flags that the user has not
enabled are added or removed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This
option ignores the state of the &quot;test&quot; USE flag,
since that flag has a special binding to
FEATURES=&quot;test&quot; (see <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more
information about <b>FEATURES</b> settings).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;changelog</b>
(<b>&minus;l</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use this in conjunction with
the <b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> option. This will show the
ChangeLog entries for all the packages that will be
upgraded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;color &lt; y |
n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable color output.
This option will override <i>NOCOLOR</i> (see
<b>make.conf</b>(5)) and may also be used to force color
output when stdout is not a tty (by default, color is
disabled unless stdout is a tty).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;columns</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Used alongside
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> to cause the package name, new
version, and old version to be displayed in an aligned
format for easy cut&minus;n&minus;paste.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This causes <b>emerge</b> to
consider the deep dependencies of all packages from the
world set. With this option enabled, <b>emerge</b> will bail
out if it determines that the given operation will break any
dependencies of the packages that have been added to the
graph. Like the <b>&minus;&minus;deep</b> option, the
<b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph</b> option will
significantly increase the time taken for dependency
calculations. Note that, unlike the
<b>&minus;&minus;deep</b> option, the
<b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph</b> option does not
cause any more packages to be updated than would have
otherwise been updated with the option disabled. Using
<b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;bdeps=y</b> together with
<b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph</b> makes the graph as
complete as possible.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph&minus;if&minus;new&minus;use
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Trigger the
<b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph</b> behavior if USE or
IUSE will change for an installed package. This option is
enabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph&minus;if&minus;new&minus;ver
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Trigger the
<b>&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph</b> behavior if an
installed package version will change (upgrade or
downgrade). This option is enabled by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;config&minus;root=DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the
<b>PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT</b> environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;debug</b>
(<b>&minus;d</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to run the emerge
command in <b>&minus;&minus;debug</b> mode. In this mode the
bash build environment will run with the &minus;x option,
causing it to output verbose debugging information to
stdout. This also enables a plethora of other output (mostly
dependency resolution messages).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;deep
[DEPTH]</b> (<b>&minus;D</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This flag forces <b>emerge</b>
to consider the entire dependency tree of packages, instead
of checking only the immediate dependencies of the packages.
As an example, this catches updates in libraries that are
not directly listed in the dependencies of a package. Also
see <b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;bdeps</b> for behavior with
respect to build time dependencies that are not strictly
required.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;depclean&minus;lib&minus;check
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Account for library link-level
dependencies during <b>&minus;&minus;depclean</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;prune</b> actions. This option is enabled
by default. If FEATURES=&quot;preserve&minus;libs&quot; is
enabled in <b>make.conf</b>(5), and preserve&minus;libs is
not restricted for any of the packages selected for removal,
then this option is ignored because any libraries that have
consumers will simply be preserved.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;digest</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Prevent corruption from being
noticed. The &lsquo;repoman manifest&lsquo; command is the
preferred way to generate manifests and it is capable of
doing an entire repository or category at once (see
<b>repoman</b>(1)).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;dynamic&minus;deps
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In dependency calculations,
substitute the dependencies of installed packages with the
dependencies of corresponding unbuilt ebuilds from source
repositories. This causes the effective dependencies of
installed packages to vary dynamically when source ebuild
dependencies are modified. This option is enabled by
default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING:</b>
If you want to disable &minus;&minus;dynamic&minus;deps,
then it may be necessary to first run <b>fixpackages</b>(1)
in order to get the best results. The <b>fixpackages</b>(1)
command performs two different operations that can also be
performed separately by the &lsquo;emaint &minus;&minus;fix
moveinst&lsquo; and &lsquo;emaint &minus;&minus;fix
movebin&lsquo; commands (see <b>emaint</b>(1)).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;emptytree</b>
(<b>&minus;e</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Reinstalls target atoms and
their entire deep dependency tree, as though no packages are
currently installed. You should run this with
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> first to make sure the result
is what you expect.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;exclude</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package names or slot atoms. Emerge won&rsquo;t install any
ebuild or binary package that matches any of the given
package atoms.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fail&minus;clean
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Clean up temporary files after
a build failure. This is particularly useful if you have
<b>PORTAGE_TMPDIR</b> on tmpfs. If this option is enabled,
you probably also want to enable <b>PORT_LOGDIR</b> (see
<b>make.conf</b>(5)) in order to save the build log.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fetchonly</b>
(<b>&minus;f</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instead of doing any package
building, just perform fetches for all packages (fetch
things from SRC_URI based upon USE setting).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;fetch&minus;all&minus;uri</b>
(<b>&minus;F</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instead of doing any package
building, just perform fetches for all packages (fetch
everything in SRC_URI regardless of USE setting).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;getbinpkg [ y
| n ] (&minus;g short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Using the server and location
defined in <i>PORTAGE_BINHOST</i> (see <b>make.conf</b>(5)),
portage will download the information from each binary
package found and it will use that information to help build
the dependency list. This option implies <b>&minus;k</b>.
(Use <b>&minus;gK</b> for binary&minus;only merging.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;getbinpkgonly
[ y | n ] (&minus;G short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is identical to
<b>&minus;g</b>, as above, except binaries from the remote
server are preferred over local packages if they are not
identical.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ignore-default-opts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Causes
<i>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</i> (see <b>make.conf</b>(5)) to be
ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;built&minus;slot&minus;operator&minus;deps
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ignore the slot/sub&minus;slot
:= operator parts of dependencies that have been recorded
when packages where built. This option is intended only for
debugging purposes, and it only affects built packages that
specify slot/sub&minus;slot := operator dependencies which
are supported beginning with <b>EAPI 5</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;soname&minus;deps
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Ignore the soname dependencies
of binary and installed packages. This option is enabled by
default, since soname dependencies are relatively new, and
the required metadata is not guaranteed to exist for binary
and installed packages built with older versions of portage.
Also, soname dependencies will be automatically ignored for
dependency calculations that can pull unbuilt ebuilds into
the dependency graph, since unbuilt ebuilds do not have any
soname dependency metadata, making it impossible to
determine whether an unresolved soname dependency can be
satisfied. Therefore, <b>&minus;&minus;usepkgonly</b> (or
<b>&minus;&minus;getbinpkgonly</b>) must be used in order to
enable soname depedency resolution when installing
packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>-j [JOBS],
&minus;&minus;jobs[=JOBS]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies the number of
packages to build simultaneously. If this option is given
without an argument, emerge will not limit the number of
jobs that can run simultaneously. Also see the related
<b>&minus;&minus;load&minus;average</b> option. Similarly to
the &minus;&minus;quiet&minus;build option, the
&minus;&minus;jobs option causes all build output to be
redirected to logs. Note that interactive packages currently
force a setting of <i>&minus;&minus;jobs=1</i>. This issue
can be temporarily avoided by specifying
<i>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;properties=&minus;interactive</i>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;keep&minus;going
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Continue as much as possible
after an error. When an error occurs, dependencies are
recalculated for remaining packages and any with unsatisfied
dependencies are automatically dropped. Also see the related
<b>&minus;&minus;skipfirst</b> option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;load&minus;average
[LOAD]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specifies that no new builds
should be started if there are other builds running and the
load average is at least LOAD (a floating-point number).
With no argument, removes a previous load limit. This option
is recommended for use in combination with
<b>&minus;&minus;jobs</b> in order to avoid excess load. See
<b>make</b>(1) for information about analogous options that
should be configured via <b>MAKEOPTS</b> in
<b>make.conf</b>(5).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;misspell&minus;suggestions
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable misspell
suggestions. By default, emerge will show a list of packages
with similar names when a package doesn&rsquo;t exist. The
<i>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</i> variable may be used to disable
this option by default.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;newrepo</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to recompile a
package if it is now being pulled from a different
repository. This option also implies the
<b>&minus;&minus;selective</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;newuse</b>
(<b>&minus;N</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to include
installed packages where USE flags have changed since
compilation. This option also implies the
<b>&minus;&minus;selective</b> option. USE flag changes
include:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A USE flag was
added to a package. A USE flag was removed from a package. A
USE flag was turned on for a package. A USE flag was turned
off for a package.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">USE flags may
be toggled by your profile as well as your USE and
package.use settings. If you would like to skip rebuilds for
which disabled flags have been added to or removed from
IUSE, see the related <b>&minus;&minus;changed&minus;use</b>
option. If you would like to skip rebuilds for specific
packages, see the <b>&minus;&minus;exclude</b> option.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: This
option ignores the state of the &quot;test&quot; USE flag,
since that flag has a special binding to
FEATURES=&quot;test&quot; (see <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more
information about <b>FEATURES</b> settings).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;noconfmem</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Causes portage to disregard
merge records indicating that a config file inside of a
<b>CONFIG_PROTECT</b> directory has been merged already.
Portage will normally merge those files only once to prevent
the user from dealing with the same config multiple times.
This flag will cause the file to always be merged.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;nodeps</b>
(<b>&minus;O</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Merges specified packages
without merging any dependencies. Note that the build may
fail if the dependencies aren&rsquo;t satisfied.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;noreplace</b>
(<b>&minus;n</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Skips the packages specified on
the command&minus;line that have already been installed.
Without this option, any package atoms or package sets you
specify on the command&minus;line <b>will</b> cause Portage
to remerge the package, even if it is already installed.
Note that Portage will not remerge dependencies by default.
This option can be used to update the world file without
rebuilding the packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;nospinner</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disables the spinner for the
session. The spinner is active when the terminal device is
determined to be a TTY. This flag disables it
regardless.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;usepkg&minus;exclude</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package names or slot atoms. Emerge will ignore matching
binary packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;exclude</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package names or slot atoms. Emerge will not rebuild
matching packages due to <b>&minus;&minus;rebuild</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;ignore</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package names or slot atoms. Emerge will not rebuild
packages that depend on matching packages due to
<b>&minus;&minus;rebuild</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;oneshot</b>
(<b>&minus;1</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Emerge as normal, but do not
add the packages to the world file for later updating.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;onlydeps</b>
(<b>&minus;o</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Only merge (or pretend to
merge) the dependencies of the packages specified, not the
packages themselves.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;package&minus;moves
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Perform package moves when
necessary. This option is enabled by default. Package moves
are typically applied immediately after a
<b>&minus;&minus;sync</b> action. They are applied in an
incremental fashion, using only the subset of the history of
package moves which have been added or modified since the
previous application of package moves.</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>WARNING:</b>
This option should remain enabled under normal
circumstances. Do not disable it unless you know what you
are doing.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>NOTE:</b>
The <b>fixpackages</b>(1) command can be used to
exhaustively apply the entire history of package moves,
regardless of whether or not any of the package moves have
been previously applied.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;pkg&minus;format</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Specify which binary package
format will be created as target. Possible choices now are
tar and rpm or their combinations.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;prefix=DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the <b>EPREFIX</b>
environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b>
(<b>&minus;p</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Instead of actually performing
the merge, simply display what *would* have been installed
if <b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> weren&rsquo;t used. Using
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> is strongly recommended before
installing an unfamiliar package. In the printout:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-75141.png" alt="Image grohtml-75141.png"></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;quiet [ y | n
] (&minus;q short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Results may vary, but the
general outcome is a reduced or condensed output from
portage&rsquo;s displays.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;build
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Redirect all build output to
logs alone, and do not display it on stdout. If a build
failure occurs for a single package, the build log will be
automatically displayed on stdout (unless the
<i>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;fail</i> option is enabled). If
there are multiple build failures (due to options like
&minus;&minus;keep&minus;going or &minus;&minus;jobs), then
the content of the log files will not be displayed, and
instead the paths of the log files will be displayed
together with the corresponding die messages. Note that
interactive packages currently force all build output to be
displayed on stdout. This issue can be temporarily avoided
by specifying
<i>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;properties=&minus;interactive</i>.
Further, note that disabling
<i>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;build</i> has no effect if
<i>&minus;&minus;jobs</i> is set to anything higher than
1.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;fail
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Suppresses display of the build
log on stdout when build output is hidden due to options
such as <i>&minus;&minus;jobs</i>,
<i>&minus;&minus;quiet</i>, or
<i>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;build</i>. Only the die message
and the path of the build log will be displayed on
stdout.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;repo&minus;display</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In the package merge list
display, suppress ::repository output, and instead use
numbers to indicate which repositories package come
from.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;quiet&minus;unmerge&minus;warn</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Disable the warning message
that&rsquo;s shown prior to <b>&minus;&minus;unmerge</b>
actions. This option is intended to be set in the
<b>make.conf</b>(5) <b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rage&minus;clean</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;"><b>WARNING: This action can
remove important packages!
&minus;&minus;rage&minus;clean</b> does
<b>&minus;&minus;unmerge</b> with <b>CLEAN_DELAY=0</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;read&minus;news
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Offer to read news via eselect
if there are unread news. This option has no effect unless
<b>&minus;&minus;ask</b> is enabled.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;if&minus;new&minus;slot
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Automatically rebuild or
reinstall packages when slot/sub&minus;slot := operator
dependencies can be satisfied by a newer slot, so that older
packages slots will become eligible for removal by the
&minus;&minus;depclean action as soon as possible. This
option only affects packages that specify
slot/sub&minus;slot := dependencies which are supported
beginning with <b>EAPI 5</b>. Since this option requires
checking of reverse dependencies, it enables
&minus;&minus;complete&minus;graph mode whenever a new slot
is installed. This option is enabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">NOTE: If you
want to skip all rebuilds involving slot&minus;operator
dependecies (including those that involve sub&minus;slot
changes alone), then
<i>&minus;&minus;ignore&minus;built&minus;slot&minus;operator&minus;deps=y</i>
is the option that you are looking for, since
<i>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;if&minus;new&minus;slot</i>
does not affect rebuilds triggered by sub&minus;slot changes
alone.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;if&minus;new&minus;rev
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rebuild packages when
build&minus;time dependencies are built from source, if the
dependency is not already installed with the same version
and revision.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;if&minus;new&minus;ver
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rebuild packages when
build&minus;time dependencies are built from source, if the
dependency is not already installed with the same version.
Revision numbers are ignored.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuild&minus;if&minus;unbuilt
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Rebuild packages when
build&minus;time dependencies are built from source.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuilt&minus;binaries
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Replace installed packages with
binary packages that have been rebuilt. Rebuilds are
detected by comparison of BUILD_TIME package metadata. This
option is enabled automatically when using binary packages
(<b>&minus;&minus;usepkgonly</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;getbinpkgonly</b>) together with
<b>&minus;&minus;update</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;deep</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;rebuilt&minus;binaries&minus;timestamp=TIMESTAMP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option modifies
emerge&rsquo;s behaviour only if
<b>&minus;&minus;rebuilt&minus;binaries</b> is given. Only
binaries that have a BUILD_TIME that is larger than the
given TIMESTAMP and that is larger than that of the
installed package will be considered by the
rebuilt&minus;binaries logic.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;reinstall
changed&minus;use</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is an alias for
<b>&minus;&minus;changed&minus;use</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;reinstall&minus;atoms</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package names or slot atoms. Emerge will treat matching
packages as if they are not installed, and reinstall them if
necessary.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;root=DIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the <b>ROOT</b> environment
variable.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;root&minus;deps[=rdeps]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If no argument is given then
build&minus;time dependencies of packages for <b>ROOT</b>
are installed to <b>ROOT</b> instead of /. If the
<b>rdeps</b> argument is given then discard all
build&minus;time dependencies of packages for <b>ROOT</b>.
This option is only meaningful when used together with
<b>ROOT</b> and it should not be enabled under normal
circumstances!</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Does not affect
EAPIs that support <b>HDEPEND</b>. Experimental <b>EAPI
5-hdepend</b> provides <b>HDEPEND</b> as a new means to
adjust installation into &quot;<i>/</i>&quot; and
<b>ROOT</b>. If ebuilds using EAPIs which <i>do not</i>
support <b>HDEPEND</b> are built in the same <b>emerge</b>
run as those using EAPIs which <i>do</i> support
<b>HDEPEND</b>, this option affects only the former.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;search&minus;index
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Enable or disable indexed
search for search actions. This option is enabled by
default. The search index needs to be regenerated by
<b>egencache</b>(1) after changes are made to a repository
(see the
<b>&minus;&minus;update&minus;pkg&minus;desc&minus;index</b>
action). This setting can be added to
<b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> (see <b>make.conf</b>(5)) and
later overridden via the command line.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;select [ y | n
] (&minus;w short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Add specified packages to the
world set (inverse of <b>&minus;&minus;oneshot</b>). This is
useful if you want to use <b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> to make
<b>&minus;&minus;oneshot</b> behavior default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;selective [ y
| n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This is identical to the
<b>&minus;&minus;noreplace</b> option. Some options, such as
<b>&minus;&minus;update</b>, imply
<b>&minus;&minus;selective</b>. Use
<b>&minus;&minus;selective=n</b> if you want to forcefully
disable <b>&minus;&minus;selective</b>, regardless of
options like <b>&minus;&minus;changed&minus;use</b>,
<b>&minus;&minus;newuse</b>, <b>&minus;&minus;noreplace</b>,
or <b>&minus;&minus;update</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;skipfirst</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">This option is only valid when
used with <b>&minus;&minus;resume</b>. It removes the first
package in the resume list. Dependencies are recalculated
for remaining packages and any that have unsatisfied
dependencies or are masked will be automatically dropped.
Also see the related <b>&minus;&minus;keep&minus;going</b>
option.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;sync&minus;submodule
&lt;glsa|news|profiles&gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Restrict sync to the specified
submodule(s). This option may be specified multiple times,
in order to sync multiple submodules. Currently, this option
has no effect for sync protocols other than rsync. (--sync
action only)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;tree</b>
(<b>&minus;t</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Shows the dependency tree for
the given target by indenting dependencies. This is only
really useful in combination with
<b>&minus;&minus;emptytree</b> or
<b>&minus;&minus;update</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;deep</b>.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;unordered&minus;display</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">By default the displayed merge
list is sorted using the order in which the packages will be
merged. When <b>&minus;&minus;tree</b> is used together with
this option, this constraint is removed, hopefully leading
to a more readable dependency tree.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;update</b>
(<b>&minus;u</b>)</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Updates packages to the best
version available, which may not always be the highest
version number due to masking for testing and development.
Package atoms specified on the command line are greedy,
meaning that unspecific atoms may match multiple versions of
slotted packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;use&minus;ebuild&minus;visibility
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use unbuilt ebuild metadata for
visibility checks on built packages.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;useoldpkg&minus;atoms</b>
ATOMS</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">A space separated list of
package names or slot atoms. Emerge will prefer matching
binary packages over newer unbuilt packages.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;usepkg [ y | n
] (&minus;k short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to use binary
packages (from $PKGDIR) if they are available, thus possibly
avoiding some time&minus;consuming compiles. This option is
useful for CD installs; you can export
PKGDIR=/mnt/cdrom/packages and then use this option to have
emerge &quot;pull&quot; binary packages from the CD in order
to satisfy dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;usepkgonly [ y
| n ] (&minus;K short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tells emerge to only use binary
packages (from $PKGDIR). All the binary packages must be
available at the time of dependency calculation or emerge
will simply abort. Portage does not use ebuild repositories
when calculating dependency information so all masking
information is ignored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;verbose [ y |
n ] (&minus;v short option)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Tell emerge to run in verbose
mode. Currently this flag causes emerge to print out GNU
info errors, if any, and to show the USE flags that will be
used for each package when pretending. The following symbols
are affixed to USE flags in order to indicate their
status:</p>


<p align="center" style="margin-top: 1em"><img src="grohtml-75142.png" alt="Image grohtml-75142.png"></p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;verbose&minus;conflicts</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Make slot conflicts more
verbose. Note that this may in some cases output hundreds of
packages for slot conflicts.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;verbose&minus;slot&minus;rebuilds
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Turns on/off the extra emerge
output to list which packages are causing rebuilds. The
default is set to &quot;y&quot; (on).</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;bdeps
&lt; y | n &gt;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">In dependency calculations,
pull in build time dependencies that are not strictly
required. This defaults to &acute;n&acute; for installation
actions, meaning they will not be installed, and
&acute;y&acute; for the <b>&minus;&minus;depclean</b>
action, meaning they will not be removed. This setting can
be added to <b>EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS</b> (see make.conf(5))
and later overridden via the command line.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>&minus;&minus;with&minus;test&minus;deps
[ y | n ]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">For packages matched by
arguments, this option will pull in dependencies that are
conditional on the &quot;test&quot; USE flag, even if
&quot;test&quot; is not enabled in <b>FEATURES</b> for the
matched packages. (see <b>make.conf</b>(5) for more
information about <b>FEATURES</b> settings).</p>

<h2>ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
<a name="ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>EPREFIX</b>
= <i>[path]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>EPREFIX</b> to specify
the target prefix to be used for merging packages or
ebuilds. This variable can be set via the
<b>&minus;&minus;prefix</b> option or in <b>make.conf</b>(5)
(the command line overrides other settings). <br>
Defaults to the prefix where portage is currently
installed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>ROOT</b> = <i>[path]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>ROOT</b> to specify the
target root filesystem to be used for merging packages or
ebuilds. This variable can be set via the
<b>&minus;&minus;root</b> option or in <b>make.conf</b>(5)
(the command line overrides other settings). <br>
Defaults to /.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT</b> =
<i>[path]</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Use <b>PORTAGE_CONFIGROOT</b>
to specify the location for various portage configuration
files (see <b>FILES</b> for a detailed list of configuration
files). This variable can be set via the
<b>&minus;&minus;config&minus;root</b> option. <br>
Defaults to /.</p>

<h2>OUTPUT
<a name="OUTPUT"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When utilizing
<b>emerge</b> with the <b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b> flags, the output may be a
little hard to understand at first. This section explains
the abbreviations. <b><br>
[blocks B ] app&minus;text/dos2unix
(&quot;app&minus;text/dos2unix&quot; is blocking <br>
app&minus;text/hd2u&minus;0.8.0)</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Dos2unix is Blocking hd2u from
being emerged. Blockers are defined when two packages will
clobber each others files, or otherwise cause some form of
breakage in your system. However, blockers usually do not
need to be simultaneously emerged because they usually
provide the same functionality.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild N ]
app&minus;games/qstat&minus;25c</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Qstat is New to your system,
and will be emerged for the first time.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild NS ]
dev-libs/glib-2.4.7</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">You already have a version of
glib installed, but a &rsquo;new&rsquo; version in a
different SLOT is available.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild R ]
sys&minus;apps/sed&minus;4.0.5</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Sed 4.0.5 has already been
emerged, but if you run the command, then portage will
Re&minus;emerge the specified package (sed in this
case).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild F ]
media&minus;video/realplayer&minus;8&minus;r6</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The realplayer package requires
that you Fetch the sources manually. When you attempt to
emerge the package, if the sources are not found, then
portage will halt and you will be provided with instructions
on how to download the required files.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild f ]
media&minus;video/realplayer&minus;8&minus;r6</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The realplayer package&rsquo;s
files are already downloaded.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild U ]
net&minus;fs/samba&minus;2.2.8_pre1 [2.2.7a]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Samba 2.2.7a has already been
emerged and can be Updated to version 2.2.8_pre1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild UD]
media&minus;libs/libgd&minus;1.8.4 [2.0.11]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Libgd 2.0.11 is already
emerged, but if you run the command, then portage will
Downgrade to version 1.8.4 for you. <br>
This may occur if a newer version of a package has been
masked because it is broken or it creates a security risk on
your system and a fix has not been released yet. <br>
Another reason this may occur is if a package you are trying
to emerge requires an older version of a package in order to
emerge successfully. In this case, libgd 2.x is incompatible
with libgd 1.x. This means that packages that were created
with libgd 1.x will not compile with 2.x and must downgrade
libgd first before they can emerge.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild U ]
sys&minus;devel/distcc&minus;2.16 [2.13&minus;r1]
USE=&quot;ipv6* &minus;gtk &minus;qt%&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Here we see that the make.conf
variable <b>USE</b> affects how this package is built. In
this example, ipv6 optional support is enabled and both gtk
and qt support are disabled. The asterisk following ipv6
indicates that ipv6 support was disabled the last time this
package was installed. The percent sign following qt
indicates that the qt option has been added to the package
since it was last installed. For information about all
<b>USE</b> symbols, see the <b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b>
option documentation above. <b><br>
*Note:</b> Flags that haven&rsquo;t changed since the last
install are only displayed when you use the
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> and
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b> options. Using the
<b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b> option will prevent all
information from being displayed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild r U ]
dev&minus;libs/icu&minus;50.1.1:0/50.1.1
[50.1&minus;r2:0/50.1]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Icu 50.1&minus;r2 has already
been emerged and can be Updated to version 50.1.1. The
<b>r</b> symbol indicates that a sub&minus;slot change (from
50.1 to 50.1.1 in this case) will force packages having
slot&minus;operator dependencies on it to be rebuilt (as
libxml2 will be rebuilt in the next example).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild rR ]
dev&minus;libs/libxml2&minus;2.9.0&minus;r1:2
USE=&quot;icu&quot;</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Libxml2 2.9.0&minus;r1 has
already been emerged, but if you run the command, then
portage will Re&minus;emerge it in order to satisfy a
slot&minus;operator dependency which forces it to be rebuilt
when the icu sub&minus;slot changes (as it changed in the
previous example).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>[ebuild U *]
sys&minus;apps/portage&minus;2.2.0_alpha6 [2.1.9.25]</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Portage 2.1.9.25 is installed,
but if you run the command, then portage will upgrade to
version 2.2.0_alpha6. In this case, the <b>*</b> symbol is
displayed, in order to indicate that version 2.2.0_alpha6 is
masked by missing keyword. This type of masking display is
disabled by the <b>&minus;&minus;quiet</b> option if the
<b>&minus;&minus;verbose</b> option is not enabled
simultaneously. The following symbols are used to indicate
various types of masking:</p>

</td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">You should almost always precede
any package install or update attempt with a
<b>&minus;&minus;pretend</b> install or update. This lets
you see how much will be done, and shows you any blocking
packages that you will have to rectify. This goes doubly so
for the <b>system</b> and <b>world</b> sets, which can
update a large number of packages if the portage tree has
been particularly active.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You also want
to typically use <b>&minus;&minus;update</b>, which ignores
packages that are already fully updated but updates those
that are not.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When you
install a package with uninstalled dependencies and do not
explicitly state those dependencies in the list of
parameters, they will not be added to the world file. If you
want them to be detected for world updates, make sure to
explicitly list them as parameters to <b>emerge</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>USE

you avoid using some dependencies you may not want to have.
<b>USE flags specified on the command line are NOT

&minus;gnome&quot; emerge mc</b> will emerge mc with those
USE settings (on Bourne-compatible shells you may omit the
<b>env</b> part). If you want those USE settings to be more
permanent, you can put them in /etc/portage/package.use
instead.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If <b>emerge
&minus;&minus;update @system</b> or <b>emerge
&minus;&minus;update @world</b> fails with an error message,
it may be that an ebuild uses some newer feature not present
in this version of <b>emerge</b>. You can use <b>emerge
&minus;&minus;update portage</b> to upgrade to the lastest

features.</p>

<h2>MASKED PACKAGES
<a name="MASKED PACKAGES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>NOTE: Please
use caution when using development packages. Problems and
bugs resulting from misusing masked packages drains Gentoo
developer time. Please be sure you are capable of handling
any problems that may ensue.</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Masks in
<b>portage</b> have many uses: they allow a testing period
where the packages can be used in live machines; they
prevent the use of a package when it will fail; and they
mask existing packages that are broken or could pose a
security risk. Read below to find out how to unmask in
various cases. Also note that if you give <b>emerge</b> an
ebuild, then all forms of masking will be ignored and
<b>emerge</b> will attempt to emerge the package. <b><br>
backtracking</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When packages are masked for
<b>backtracking</b>, it means that the dependency resolver
has temporarily masked them in order to avoid dependency
conflicts and/or unsatisfied dependencies. This type of mask
is typically accompanied by a message about a missed package
update which has been skipped in order to avoid dependency
conflicts and/or unsatisfied dependencies.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>package.mask</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>package.mask</b> file
primarily blocks the use of packages that cause problems or
are known to have issues on different systems. It resides in
<i>/usr/portage/profiles</i>.</p>

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>KEYWORDS</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>KEYWORDS</b> variable in
an <b>ebuild</b> file is also used for masking a package
still in testing. There are architecture&minus;specific
keywords for each package that let <b>portage</b> know which
systems are compatible with the package. Packages which
compile on an architecture, but have not been proven to be
&quot;stable&quot;, are masked with a tilde (<b>~</b>) in
front of the architecture name. <b>emerge</b> examines the
<b>ACCEPT_KEYWORDS</b> environment variable to allow or
disallow the emerging of a package masked by
<b>KEYWORDS</b>. To inform <b>emerge</b> that it should
build these &rsquo;testing&rsquo; versions of packages, you
should update your
<i>/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords</i> file to list the
packages you want the &acute;testing&acute; version. See
<b>portage</b>(5) for more information.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>LICENSE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>LICENSE</b> variable in
an <b>ebuild</b> file can be used to mask packages based on
licensing restrictions. <b>emerge</b> examines the
<b>ACCEPT_LICENSE</b> environment variable to allow or
disallow the emerging of a package masked by <b>LICENSE</b>.
See <b>make.conf</b>(5) for information about
<b>ACCEPT_LICENSE</b>, and see <b>portage</b>(5) for
information about <i>/etc/portage/package.license</i>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>PROPERTIES</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>PROPERTIES</b> variable
in an <b>ebuild</b> file can be used to mask packages based
on properties restrictions. <b>emerge</b> examines the
<b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b> environment variable to allow or
disallow the emerging of a package masked by
<b>PROPERTIES</b>. See <b>make.conf</b>(5) for information
about <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b>, and see <b>portage</b>(5)
for information about
<i>/etc/portage/package.properties</i>. Use the
<b>&minus;&minus;accept&minus;properties</b> option to
temporarily override <b>ACCEPT_PROPERTIES</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>RESTRICT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The <b>RESTRICT</b> variable in
an <b>ebuild</b> file can be used to mask packages based on
RESTRICT tokens. <b>emerge</b> examines the
<b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b> environment variable to allow or
disallow the emerging of a package masked by
<b>RESTRICT</b>. See <b>make.conf</b>(5) for information
about <b>ACCEPT_RESTRICT</b>, and see <b>portage</b>(5) for
information about
<i>/etc/portage/package.accept_restrict</i>. Use the

<h2>CONFIGURATION FILES
<a name="CONFIGURATION FILES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Portage has a
special feature called &quot;config file protection&quot;.
The purpose of this feature is to prevent new package
installs from clobbering existing configuration files. By
default, config file protection is turned on for /etc and
the KDE configuration dirs; more may be added in the
future.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When Portage
installs a file into a protected directory tree like /etc,
any existing files will not be overwritten. If a file of the
same name already exists, Portage will change the name of
the to&minus;be&minus;installed file from &rsquo;foo&rsquo;
to &acute;._cfg0000_foo&acute;. If
&acute;._cfg0000_foo&acute; already exists, this name
becomes &acute;._cfg0001_foo&acute;, etc. In this way,
existing files are not overwritten, allowing the
administrator to manually merge the new config files and
avoid any unexpected changes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In addition to
protecting overwritten files, Portage will not delete any
files from a protected directory when a package is unmerged.
While this may be a little bit untidy, it does prevent
potentially valuable config files from being deleted, which
is of paramount importance.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Protected
directories are set using the <i>CONFIG_PROTECT</i>
variable, normally defined in make.globals. Directory
exceptions to the CONFIG_PROTECTed directories can be
specified using the <i>CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK</i> variable. To
find files that need to be updated in /etc, type <b>find
/etc &minus;name '._cfg????_*'</b>.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">You can disable
this feature by setting
<i>CONFIG_PROTECT=&quot;&minus;*&quot;</i> in
<b>make.conf</b>(5). Then, Portage will mercilessly
auto&minus;update your config files. Alternatively, you can
leave Config File Protection on but tell Portage that it can
overwrite files in certain specific /etc subdirectories. For
example, if you wanted Portage to automatically update your
rc scripts and your wget configuration, but didn&rsquo;t
want any other changes made without your explicit approval,
you&rsquo;d add this to <b>make.conf</b>(5):</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><i>CONFIG_PROTECT_MASK=&quot;/etc/wget
/etc/rc.d&quot;</i></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Tools such as
dispatch&minus;conf, cfg&minus;update, and etc&minus;update
are also available to aid in the merging of these files.
They provide interactive merging and can auto&minus;merge
trivial changes.</p>
