Introduction

As is mentioned in the [About Me](/about-me/) section of this website, I have tried quite a few Linux distributions using **Oracle VM VirtualBox**. Some I have only spent less than an hour using, but those I have spent over an hour with and feel fairly confident in my ability to review, include:

1. [antiX](#antiX)
2. [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
3. [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/)
4. [Debian](http://debian.org/)
5. [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
6. [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/)
7. [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com/)
8. [Mageia](http://www.mageia.org/en/)
9. [Manjaro Linux](https://manjaro.github.io)
10. [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
11. [PC-BSD](http://www.pcbsd.org/)
12. [PCLinuxOS](http://www.pclinuxos.com/)
13. [Sabayon Linux](http://www.sabayon.org/)
14. [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)


#antiX
{% include image.html url="/images/antiX-15.png" width = "500px" description="antiX 15 running in VirtualBox" %}
{% include distros.html url="http://antix.mepis.org/index.php?title=Main_Page" forum="http://antix.freeforums.org/" dw="antix" wp="antiX" %} is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Debian's 'Testing' branch for 32-bit (i486 or better) and 64-bit systems. It is essentially designed to be a lightweight distribution as it uses the IceWM window manager as its default user interface. I have found it fairly user-friendly with a graphical installer and a fresh install takes up less than 3 GB hard drive space.
