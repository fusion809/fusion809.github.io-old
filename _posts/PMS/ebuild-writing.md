## ebuild Writing
{% include note.md note1="This section is for advanced users (or those that are interested in attaining this level of understanding) and is mostly based on the [official ebuild writing guide](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/)." %}
**ebuild writing** and **testing** are two of the most important, yet difficult activities for Gentoo developers to do. Efficient ebuild writing requires a good knowledge of [Bash scripting](/2015/11/26/bash-scripting-and-the-command-line-an-introduction-for-sabayon-users/), which I do not even possess, so bare with me. ebuilds can contain traditional Bash functions and calls to standard POSIX utilities (such as `cp` or `mv`), as well as specialized ebuild functions and code snippets (which are known as **eclasses**). ebuilds are so varied in their contents and structure that it is difficult for me to find a reasonable example with which to teach their general structure. This is partly because many ebuilds have components that are specific to them and take up so much space that I do not wish to include them here. This is probably the best ebuild example I can provide (which is in the Portage Tree):

The header in lines one to three is common to all ebuilds, with the date `1999-2015` being adjusted every new year (e.g., in 2016 it will be replaced with `1999-2016`). Line 5, 8-10, 12-15, 17-21 is where ebuild variables are being defined.

{% include PMS/table8-ebuild-variables.html %}
The sixth line, `inherit eutils games`, is where eclass functions are inherited (inheriting means makes them available to the ebuild).
