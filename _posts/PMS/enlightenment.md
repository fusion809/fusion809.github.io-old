#### Enlightenment
{% include links.html package="x11-wm/enlightenment" program="Enlightenment" link="https://www.enlightenment.org" wp="Enlightenment (software)" gw="Enlightenment" %} is a free and open-source (BSD Licensed) feature-packed window manager that had its initial release in 1997. This initial release was dubbed Enlightenment DR16 and later in December 2012 (after 12 years of development) the DR17 series of Enlightenment had its first stable release. Both series (DR16 and DR17) are still under active, independent development. DR16 releases tend to be lighter weight (taking up less system resources) than their corresponding DR17 releases, although DR17 are usually more feature-packed and aesthetically pleasing (or at least in my opinion). The DR17 series itself has its own set of branches: E17 (the original stable DR17 release in December 2012), E18 (released December 2013), E19 (released September 2014) and E20 (released November 2015).

As of {{ page.date | date: "%d %B %Y" }} the latest release of the DR16 series is present in the Portage Tree and Entropy repositories, although the E20 branch of the DR17 series is yet to be added to either repository. The latest releases of the Enlightenment libraries (namely 1.16.0 for all of these packages): {% include links.html package="dev-libs/efl" program="EFL" wp="Enlightenment_Foundation_Libraries" puncr="," %} {% include links.html package="media-libs/elementary" program="Elementary" puncr="," %} {% include links.html package="media-plugins/evas_generic_loaders" program="Evas generic loaders" %} and {% include links.html package="media-plugins/emotion_generic_players" program="Emotion generic players" puncr="," %} are also missing from the Portage Tree and Entropy repositories. I wanted to try out Enlightenment 20 (E20) on my  Sabayon machine, to do so I had two options:
* Manually compile and install it and the dependencies  from source code
