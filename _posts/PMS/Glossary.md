## Glossary
To ensure that everything in this post is clear as day to understand I felt I should explain some acronyms, terminology and formatting conventions adopted in this post.

### Terminology
#### Binary package
A type of software package that contains an executable script that is ready to be run. They are usually compiled from the original source code. Most package managers work with binary packages, example of package managers that work with binary packages by default, include:
* [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool), the default command-line package manager used by Debian-based distributions, including Ubuntu. The binary packages used by APT have the `.deb` file extension.
* [DNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNF_(software)), which is the default package manager of Fedora &geq;22. It uses RPM packages (with the `.rpm` file extension).

#### [Software package](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager)
A distribution of software and data contained in archive files, that can be used by package managers to install software.[^1] There are two main types of software package: [binary](#binary-package) and [source code](#source-package), which are both covered separately.
