### C++
**C++** (pronounced *See-plus-plus*) is a programming language that was originally developed by Bjarne Stroustrup (1950-) while he was working at Bell Labs. Stroustrup wanted a programming language with similar features and speed to C, except with greater support for additional programming paradigms as well as some extra high-level features. Its most popular free compiler is probably the GCC too. The list of programs written mostly in C++ is very long and includes:
* {% include wp.md name="Advanced Packaging Tool" %} (APT)[^4], the default package manager of Debian and its derivatives like Ubuntu.
* {% include wp.md name="Avidemux" %}, a free and open-source video-editing program.
* {% include wp.md name="Avogadro" cat="software" %}, a free and open-source molecule editor and cheminformatics program.
* {% include wp.md name="Chromium" cat="web browser" %}, a free and open-source web browser that's source code is used as the basis for the proprietary Google Chrome web browser.
* {% include wp.md name="Opera" cat="software" %}, a free and open-source web browser. 
* {% include wp.md name="Qt" cat="software" %} (Qt), a widget toolkit that has both a freely- (LGPL/GPL-licensed) and a proprietary-licensed version available. Its free version is used as the default widget toolkit of Deepin Desktop Environment, Hawaii, KDE, LXQt, *etc.* and several other free desktop environments for &#42;nix systems including FreeBSD and Linux.
* {% include wp.md name="ZYpp" %} (`zypper` from the command-line)[^5], the default command-line package manager of openSUSE and derivatives.
