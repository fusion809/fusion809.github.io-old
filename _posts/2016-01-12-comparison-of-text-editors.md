**Text editors** are essential programs for software developers and programmers in general, as they enable users to write and edit source code files. They are popular tools used by both experienced and novice Linux users. In this post I will compare the various text editors available for Sabayon, with regard to several features and properties of each. It is important to note that I am not a programmer, my experience with programming is limited to mostly MATLAB/GNU Octave scripts, a small handful of Python scripts I wrote for technical computing (that is, numerical analysis) and a few bash scripts I have written to make my life easier, when I use Linux systems.

On Sabayon there are over a dozen different text editors (see, for example, the category [app-editors](http://gpo.zugaina.org/app-editors/) at gpo.zugaina.org) available for installation, many of these are part of the core applications of complete desktop environments, such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Each of these text editors also has its own target audience, with some being designed to be used only by seasoned programmers while others are useful only for writing simple text files. Entropy and Portage both use the category for programs relating to text editing of `app-editors`. To list the Entropy packages in this category, from the command-line, run:
{% include codeu.html line1="equo search &quot;app-editors&quot;" %}
While to list ebuilds in installed overlays, plus the Portage tree, within the category of app-editors run:
{% include codeu.html line1="emerge --search &quot;%@^app-editors&quot;" %}
To search all overlays run:
{% include codeu.html line1="eix-update &amp;&amp; eix-remote update &amp;&amp; eix -RCc &quot;app-editors&quot;" %}
This post will compare several different text editors that are available for Sabayon (I know as I have installed them all myself), with respect to several aspects.

## Bluefish
{% include image.html image="Bluefish.png" description="Bluefish running under LXDE" width="1130px" float="none" %}
### Background
**Bluefish** is a text editor, primarily intended for web development and programming, as it provides syntax highlighting support and other features mostly for web markup, programming and style sheet languages.
### Customizability
I have limited experience with Bluefish but from what I can gather, it is customizable, although I cannot comment on how extensive this customizability is.
### Features
Syntax highlighting is available for almost (if not all) all computer languages used in web development.
### Obtaining it
It can be installed with Entropy or Portage (and is available in the Portage Tree). With Entropy run:
{% include coder.html line1="equo i -av app-editors/bluefish" %}
While to install it with Portage run:
{% include coder.html line1="emerge -av app-editors/bluefish" %}
### Advantages (Pros)
* Customizable
* Has features that would appeal to a web developer
### Disadvantages (Cons)
* ?
### Ratings
<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: &gt;8. Available in the Entropy Store and from Portage</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: &gt;4. Its keyboard shortcuts are intuitive (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to copy), behind this my experience with it is not extensive enough for me to comment.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;4. It is customizable, but as I do not have much experience with this text editor, I do not know just how customizable it is.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;7. It is possible to do compiling and use integrated development environment (IDE)-type features.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: 2. It has received one vote on my poll, thus far.</li>

## Geany
[caption id="attachment_689" align="alignnone" width="1366"]<a href="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Geany-1.24.1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-689" src="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Geany-1.24.1.png" alt="Geany 1.24.1 running under Moksha" width="1366" height="740" /></a> <strong>Geany 1.24.1 running under Moksha</strong>[/caption]
<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>Geany</strong> is a lightweight GTK+ and Scintilla-based text editor with basic IDE-type features that was originally developed by Enrico Tr√∂ger in 2005. It is licensed under GNU GPLv2.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
The <code>~/.geany</code> directory is where customizations are kept. This customization can be made with code <a href="http://www.geany.org/Download/Extras">snippets</a> (written in HTML, LaTeX, PHP and Python), <a href="http://www.geany.org/Support/Plugins">plugins</a>, <a href="https://github.com/geany/geany-themes/">themes</a>, <em>etc</em>.
<h2>Features</h2>
Geany provides auto-indentation and syntax-highlighting for over a dozen different computer languages. Geany has an embedded terminal emulator. Several extra features can be added to Geany, using plugins.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
Geany can be easily installed using Entropy or Portage. Using Entropy run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i geany</div>
while to install it using Portage run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av geany</div>
The latest version of Geany in the <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/geany,126394,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">Entropy Store</a> is 1.24.1, while the latest version of Geany as of 24 October 2015 is 1.25 (released July 2015) which is available from the <a href="https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-util/geany" target="_blank">Portage Tree</a>.
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>
<ul>
<ul>
	<li>The list of supported computer languages, for syntax-highlighting and other features is fairly small, compared to Atom, Gedit, GNU Emacs and Vim. See for example, the screenshot below, showing allowed file types.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>The version of Geany in the Entropy Store is not the latest available</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages (Pros)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>It has a few IDE-type features.</li>
	<li>It is fairly lightweight.</li>
	<li>It is cross-platform, hence if you switch from Sabayon to another OS fairly frequently, it should not be too difficult to get Geany on said OS.</li>
	<li>Keyboard shortcuts are fairly intuitive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ratings</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 7-8. I am rating it a little lower than 8, as the latest version in the Entropy Store is not the latest, even though the latest has been available for three months, thus far.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 8. It seems fairly user-friendly, as its keyboard shortcuts are fairly intuitive.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 7? My experience with this TE is too limited for me to be confident with this rating.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: 5-7.</li>

Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table (remember I have neglected to include the RAM used by the embedded terminal emulator):
<pre>Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

 18.5 MiB +   3.1 MiB =  21.6 MiB	geany

## gedit
[caption id="attachment_611" align="alignnone" width="1366"]<a href="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gedit-screenshot-under-Moksha.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-611" src="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gedit-screenshot-under-Moksha.png" alt="gedit running under Moksha" width="1366" height="735" /></a> <strong>gedit running under Moksha</strong>[/caption]
<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>gedit</strong> is a GTK+ based text editor that is one of the core applications of GNOME. In my opinion, it is the second most advanced text editor (after Kate) that is part of a desktop environment's core application suite. It is also more advanced than Windows' Notepad and Wordpad text editors.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
gedit is able to be customized, although from what I have gathered from reading its Wiki, customization options are limited as it does not seem to support advanced customization (via editing configure files, for example), rather there are some themes and plugins available but the plugins seem fairly limited.
<h2>Features</h2>
It supports syntax highlighting of several computer languages, including Desktop Configuration files (<code>.desktop</code> or <code>.directory</code>), MATLAB, MediaWiki, GNU Octave, Scilab and shell script, just to name a few I know are absent in a few basic text editors. Although it does not support syntax highlighting for PyMOL or SageMath, so I would not say its syntax highlighting is as extensive as Atom's or Vim's.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
It is easy to obtain gedit on Sabayon, via either Entropy or Portage (and yes it is available in the Portage Tree). If I am not mistaken, gedit comes with a default installation of Sabayon GNOME edition. To install it using Entropy on an existing Sabayon machine, simply run (you can omit the <code>-av</code> options, if you are sure gedit is not already installed on your system, I am using these options in case it is and you are not aware of it):
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/gedit</div>
Alternatively to install it using Portage run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/gedit</div>
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Customization options, beyond with a limited set of available themes and plugins, are limited.</li>
	<li>Fairly light on features, beyond syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages (Pros)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Light on resources</li>
	<li>Easy to obtain on Sabayon</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ratings</h2>

	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 6.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: ~7.</li>

<pre>Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

 23.3 MiB +   3.5 MiB =  26.7 MiB	gedit

## GNU Emacs
[caption id="attachment_619" align="alignnone" width="1366"]<a href="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GNU-Emacs.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-619" src="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GNU-Emacs.png" alt="GNU Emacs running under Moksha" width="1366" height="740" /></a> <strong>GNU Emacs running under Moksha</strong>[/caption]
<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>GNU Emacs</strong> (<strong>GE</strong>) is an extensively-customizable text editor that is developed by the GNU Project. Its original developer was Richard Stallman, the founder of the GNU Project and its first release was in 1985. It belongs to a family of text editors called Emacs, which are text editors that are extensively customizable for users with sufficient programming knowledge. Emacs is abbreviated from <strong>E</strong>ditor <strong>Mac</strong>ro<b>s</b>, which refers to its origin as editor macros for the TECO text editor, that were developed, in part, by Richard Stallman. GE is written in C and Emacs Lisp (ELisp), a dialect of the Lisp programming language devised just for GE. ELisp is used to write extensions and provide extra functionalities for GE and related text editors like XEmacs.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
GE is one of the most customizable text editors available, but much of this customization must be done via writing code in ELisp, which limits much of this customization to advanced users only.
<h2>Features</h2>
GNU Emacs provides syntax highlighting for dozens of different computer languages, along with several features of IDEs like shell access, compiling code, using git from within GE, <em>etc. </em>The <a href="http://gpo.zugaina.org/app-emacs/" target="_blank">app-emacs</a> Portage category contains several plugins for GNU Emacs.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
GNU Emacs is available from the Entropy Store and the Portage Tree. To install it with Entropy run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/emacs</div>
while to install it with Portage run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/emacs</div>
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Has a steep learning curve for newcomers, hence making it inaccessible to newcomers to Linux and programming, in general.</li>
	<li>Has an unconventional keymap, which can take some time to learn. For example, to cut text you use <kbd>Ctrl+W</kbd>, as opposed to the usual <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>, while to paste text you use <kbd>Ctrl+Y</kbd>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages (Pros)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Extensively customizable</li>
	<li>Heavy on features, especially for advanced users that can extend it using ELisp.</li>
	<li>Provides syntax highlighting for dozens, if not hundreds, of computer languages</li>
	<li>Has its own Wiki, manual and other documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ratings</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: &gt;8. Readily available for installation on Sabayon.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: ‚â§5. Not particularly difficult for a newcomer to use as a basic text editor, but any further usage requires extensive knowledge of ELisp.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;9. Extensively customizable for all those that understand ELisp sufficiently.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: &gt;9. It is one of the most feature-packed text editors available today.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: 6. I am actually quite surprised by its lack of popularity on Sabayon, from what I have heard it should have ranked right up there with Vim for popularity.</li>
	<li><strong>SRU</strong>: 7-8. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/emacs,158951,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">Emacs 24.5</a> is a 35.8 MB download and takes up 142.2 MB HDD space when installed. Fairly lightweight as far as text editors go, RAM-wise. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table:
<pre>
Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

 31.6 MiB +   3.0 MiB =  34.5 MiB	emacs-24
---------------------------------
                         34.5 MiB
=================================
</pre>
</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 8. It is a very powerful text editor, but to me, its lack of customizability by those that do not understand ELisp is a significant disadvantage.</li>

## GNU nano
[caption id="attachment_642" align="alignnone" width="1366"]<a href="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GNU-nano-under-LXTerminal.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-642" src="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GNU-nano-under-LXTerminal.png" alt="GNU nano running within LXTerminal under Moksha" width="1366" height="740" /></a> <strong>GNU nano 2.4.2 running within LXTerminal under Moksha</strong>[/caption]
<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>GNU nano</strong> is a command-line text editor that is developed as part of the GNU Project. Its development began in 1999 by Chris Allegretta, as a free alternative to the proprietary Pico text editor. Later, in 2001, it officially became part of the GNU Project. Several features (like search, search and replace, save, exit, <em>etc.</em>) are accessed using keyboard shortcuts. It can be invoked by running the command "nano" from the command-line. nano can be passed several different options from the command-line, to see a full list see its man page (invoked by running <code>man nano</code> or, if you would prefer to view it in your browser, go <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.2/nano.1.html">here</a>). Usually when I want to edit a file with nano I simply run <code>nano &lt;FILE&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;FILE&gt;</code> is the file's name (potentially also with its path if it is not in my current directory).
<h2>Customizability</h2>
I am unaware of any possible customization of nano, if you know some please do tell me in the comments of this post.
<h2>Features</h2>
It offers syntax-highlighting, auto-indenting and miscellaneous other support for several computer languages. It also auto-detects the computer language using file extensions. It also has search functions (accessable via pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>W</kbd>).
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
It is fairly simple to get nano on Sabayon. Odds are it will already be installed by default on your Sabayon machine, so check to see if it is with <code>nano</code> (does not matter if you execute this as root or standard user). If you do not have it, you can try to install it with Entropy, via running:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/nano</div>
alternatively, to install it with Portage, run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/nano</div>
<h2>Ratings</h2>
<ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>jEdit </strong>is a Java-based text editor that began life in 1998, when Slava Pestov started developing it. Pestov later left the project in 2006, when he handed the reigns to the free software community. jEdit provides syntax highlighting for dozens of computer languages so far, and can be customized using scripts written in a variety of different programming languages such as JavaScript and Jython. As it is written in Java it can run on any Java-capable platform, including Sabayon.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
It is extensively customizable, via scripts in supported languages. Several plugins, that provide extra functionality, are available via a built-in plugin installer (under the "Plugins" menu).
<h2>Features</h2>
As previously mentioned auto-indentation and syntax-highlighting support exists for a long list of computer languages. Plugins with extra IDE-like capabilities also exist, including a plugin for using git from within jEdit, another for using a Jython interpreter from within jEdit, another for a Python shell, <em>etc.</em>
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
On Sabayon jEdit can be installed via Entropy or Portage (from the Portage Tree, no need to add unofficial overlays for it). To install it using Entropy run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/jedit</div>
while to install it using Portage run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/jedit</div>
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Heavy on system resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages (Pros)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Easy to obtain it on Sabayon</li>
	<li>Extensively customizable</li>
	<li>Has intuitive keyboard shortcuts</li>
	<li>Written in Java, hence can run on most platforms, if you end up switching to a new operating system in the future</li>
	<li>User-friendly</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ratings</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 8.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: 8. Fairly beginner-friendly, but extra functionalities beyond that available via existing plugins must be added using self-made scripts.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: &gt;8. Very customizabile.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8. Extensive auto-indentation and syntax-highlighting support for a range of computer languages, as has some IDE features.</li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: &lt;3. Not a single vote casted in its favour so far.</li>
	<li><strong>SRU</strong>: 3. <a href="https://packages.sabayon.org/show/jedit,156957,sabayon-weekly,amd64,5,standard" target="_blank">jEdit 5.2.0</a> is a 2.6 MB download and takes up 10 MB HDD space when installed. Second heaviest text editor compared in this post, after Atom, RAM-wise. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table:
<pre>
Private  +   Shared  =  RAM used	Program

128.0 MiB +   6.9 MiB = 134.9 MiB	java

<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>Kate</strong>, which is abbreviated from <strong>K</strong>DE <strong>A</strong>dvanced <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>E</strong>ditor, is a text editor that is a KDE Core Application (a part of the KDE Software Compilation or KDE SC) and combines features of an advanced text editor (that is, one geared towards software developers and experienced programmers) such as customizability, extensive syntax-highlighting, code-indentation, <em>etc.<strong> </strong></em>support with sufficient user-friendliness for it to be suitable for inexperienced Linux users. Its development began in 2001 and has been a central part of KDE SC ever since.

<strong>KWrite</strong>, as I understand it (but I must admit I am a little confused by the degree of overlap between Kate and KWrite) is designed to be a lightweight derivative of Kate.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
Some customization (such as of keyboard shortcuts, the toolbar and a few other features) can be done graphically via going to the "Settings" menu and selecting an option from the menu. From what I can gather, however, limited customization can be done textually via user-supplied scripts.
<h2>Features</h2>
It has syntax-highlighting and auto-indentation support for over 180 different computer languages, including MediaWiki and shell script, but excluding PyMOL. It also has embedded terminal support.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
Kate can be quite easily obtained from Entropy or Portage. To install it from Entropy run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av kde-apps/kate</div>
while to install it with Portage run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av kde-apps/kate</div>
Getting KWrite is similarly easy, just use (for installation with Entropy):
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av kde-apps/kwrite</div>
while to install KWrite with Portage run (no need to add any overlays, it is in the Portage Tree):
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av kde-apps/kwrite</div>
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Minimal customization can be made to Kate/KWrite, via user-supplied scripts.</li>
	<li>Due to it being part of KDE SC it cannot be too easily ported to Microsoft Windows or OS X, although it is readily available on most Linux distributions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages (Pros)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Easily customizable via graphical tools</li>
	<li>Intuitive keyboard shortcuts by default</li>
	<li>Extensive support for a wide range of computer languages</li>
</ul>

<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>Mousepad</strong> is a core application of the Xfce desktop environment, that was originally forked from Leafpad. Like Leafpad it is fairly lightweight, but unlike Leafpad, Mousepad can be customized and has a few basic features that are absent from Leafpad, such as syntax highlighting support for a few computer languages.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
Some basic customization can be done, graphically, by going to Edit‚ÜêPreferences in the toolbar. Some customization of its appearance can be done by going to the View menu. Beyond this, to my knowledge, it cannot be customized.
<h2>Features</h2>
It supports syntax-highlighting for roughly, a couple of dozen computer languages.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
It is fairly easy to obtain it on Sabayon, to install it with Entropy run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/mousepad</div>
while to install it with Portage (and yes it is available in the Portage Tree):
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/mousepad</div>
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>

<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>SciTE</strong> (abbreviated from <strong>SCi</strong>ntilla based <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>E</strong>ditor) is a Scintilla-based text editor originally developed by Neil Hodgson, that is licensed under a GPL-compatible license. It is a fairly user-friendly text editor, that can be customized and scripted with using Lua. Its syntax-highlighting is based on the contents of the <code>.properties</code> files it loads. SciTE is cross-platform, available on Microsoft Windows and most Linux distributions for free, although for OS X users it is only available for a fee of 41.99 USD.

I first tried it when it was the default text editor used by GNU Octave to edit m files.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
SciTE can be customized by editing <code>.properties</code> files or via scripting with Lua. There are no major graphical tools for customizing SciTE.
<h2>Features</h2>
It provides syntax-highlighting for dozens of computer languages. Support for extra languages can be added by creating <code>.properties</code> files for them.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
It is easy to install it with Entropy or Portage. To install it with Entropy, run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/scite</div>
To install it with Portage, run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/scite</div>

## Vim
[caption id="attachment_656" align="alignnone" width="1366"]<a href="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gVim-7.4.827-running-under-Moksha.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-656" src="http://linux.x10host.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gVim-7.4.827-running-under-Moksha.png" alt="gVim 7.4.827 running under Moksha" width="1366" height="740" /></a> <strong>gVim 7.4.827 running under Moksha</strong>[/caption]
<h2>Background</h2>
<strong>Vim</strong> (short for <strong>Vi</strong>-<strong>IM</strong>proved) is a text editor that was first released in 1991 by Bram Moolenaar, as a clone of Bill Joy's Vi text editor. It and GNU Emacs are seen as the most powerful free text editors available for experienced programmers. Vim is available as a command-line text editor, where users can edit text files from the command-line, or as a graphical text editor (which is called <strong>gVim</strong>). There is also a Qt-based GUI for Vim called Vim-Qt that is available via the Entropy Store. Compared to most text editors, Vim is far less intuitive and has a steep learning curve. For one, its keyboard shortcuts are far from conventional, with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> for copy, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> for paste, <em>etc.</em> not being available. Vim also has its own scripting language (Vim script) for adding functionalities to it.
<h2>Customizability</h2>
Vim is extensively customizable, for people with the required level of finesse in programming. There are also several extensions and other plugins available for it, from the internet.
<h2>Features</h2>
It has syntax-highlighting support for almost (if not every) every computer language. It also has several IDE-type features, like compiling source code from within it. Several other features can be added to it, for example, I wrote some of this post in Vim, using the <a href="https://github.com/PotHix/Vimpress">Vimpress plugin</a>. Several plugins are available in the <a href="http://gpo.zugaina.org/app-vim/" target="_blank">app-vim</a> Portage category.
<h2>Obtaining it</h2>
It is easy to obtain Vim (and gVim) on Sabayon using Entropy or Portage. To install Vim and gVim using Entropy, run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  equo i -av app-editors/vim app-editors/gvim</div>
whereas to install it with Portage run:
<div class="code"><span class="coder">root #</span>  emerge -av app-editors/vim app-editors/gvim</div>
<h2>Disadvantages (Cons)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Steep learning curve, making it difficult to learn. If you run <code>vimtutor</code> from the command-line after installing it, you will be taken through a tutorial of how to use it, which can be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Advantages (Pros)</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Easy to obtain it on Sabayon</li>
	<li>Extremely customizable</li>
	<li>Fairly light on system resources</li>
