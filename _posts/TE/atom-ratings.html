<ul>
	<li><strong>Availability</strong>: 3-4. It is possible to install Atom on Sabayon, but it is more error-prone than it is on more popular distributions like Debian, Fedora, openSUSE and Ubuntu, which have pre-compiled binary packages available on the Atom website.</li>
	<li><strong>Beginner-friendliness</strong>: ≥8. It is easy to get to used for beginners, as it uses the keymap as several basic text editors like gedit and Notepad.</li>
	<li><strong>Customizability</strong>: 8. It is totally customizable, for those with the skill and time. For lay persons its customizability is more limited, to customization with available packages and themes.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong>: 8. Most computer languages are covered by Atom's syntax highlighting plugins, but some are not, for example, it does not yet have support for <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/syntax-highlighting-for-desktop-configuration-files/21764">desktop configuration files.</a></li>
	<li><strong>Popularity</strong>: ≥8. While this text editor is new, its popularity on Sabayon is fairly high and increasing.</li>
	<li><strong>SRU</strong>: 2. <a href="https://github.com/fusion809/sabayon-tools" target="_blank">Atom 1.0.19</a> is a 59.4 MB download, when it is installed it takes up a total space of 196.2 MB. Here is my <code>ps mem</code> table for running under LXDE:
{% include_relative TE/atom-psmem.html %}
</li>
	<li><strong>Overall</strong>: 7-9. It is my favourite text editor, but it is still early days, its SRU and boot time are issues that are being worked on, new packages and themes are created every week. It may become easier to install it on Sabayon, in the future, perhaps in response to my <a href="https://bugs.sabayon.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5011">request</a> that Atom be added to the Sabayon overlay.</li>
