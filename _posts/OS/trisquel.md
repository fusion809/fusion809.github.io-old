### Background
{% include_relative OS/os.md os="Trisquel" dw="trisquel" url="https://trisquel.info/" wiki="https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/documentation" d="https://trisquel.info/en/download" forum="https://trisquel.info/en/forum" ml="http://listas.trisquel.info/" %} is a Spanish Ubuntu (LTS) derivative that is composed entirely of free and open-source software (FOSS), this includes the Linux-libre kernel (presently Trisquel 7 &mdash; the latest edition as of {{ page.date | %d %B %Y }} &mdash; is using the 3.13 libre version of the kernel) derivatives such as all of its official derivatives and Linux Mint it uses its own repositories, separate from Ubuntu's repositories, which contain entirely free and open-source software, as opposed to Ubuntu's repositories which are a little more liberal in their licensing requirements. It is the latest addition to this post because of the fact I have just barely had enough experience with it to write a review.

I find it aesthetically unique (afterall it does not use Ubuntu's Unity shell) from Ubuntu, although personally I do not find it anymore appealing than Ubuntu, but from the point of view of the user with regard to everything else it is pretty much identical to the Ubuntu LTS releases it is built on, except it does not have the Ubuntu Software Center, rather it has the Synaptic package manager for graphical package management.

It is presently ranked 95th for popularity according to the *DistroWatch* website.
