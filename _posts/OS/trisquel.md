It has two official editions: one based on a modified version of the GNOME desktop and another based on the LXDE desktop (which is called Trisquel Mini). It is the Linux distribution used by Richard Stallman on all his personal computers. Unlike most Ubuntu derivatives such as all of its official derivatives and Linux Mint it uses its own repositories, separate from Ubuntu's repositories. Trisquel's repositories contain only FOSS, unlike Ubuntu's repositories which are a little more liberal in their licensing. It is the latest addition to this post because of the fact I have just barely had enough experience with it to write a review.

Generally speaking I find it aesthetically unique (afterall it does not use Ubuntu's Unity shell) from Ubuntu, although personally I do not find it anymore appealing than Ubuntu, but from the point of view of the user with regard to everything else it is pretty much identical to the Ubuntu LTS releases it is built on, except it does not have the Ubuntu Software Center, rather it has the Synaptic package manager for graphical package management.
