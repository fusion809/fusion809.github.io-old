### Background
{% include_relative OS/os.md os="Trisquel" dw="trisquel" url="https://trisquel.info/" wiki="https://trisquel.info/en/wiki/documentation" d="https://trisquel.info/en/download" forum="https://trisquel.info/en/forum" ml="http://listas.trisquel.info/" %} is a Spanish Ubuntu (LTS) derivative that is composed entirely of free and open-source software (FOSS), this includes the Linux-libre kernel. It has two official editions: one based on a modified version of the GNOME desktop (presently it is using GNOME 3.8.4 &mdash; from August 2013) and another based on the LXDE desktop (which is called Trisquel Mini). It is the Linux distribution used by Richard Stallman on all of his personal computers. Unlike most Ubuntu derivatives such as all of its official derivatives and Linux Mint it uses its own repositories, separate from Ubuntu's repositories, which contain entirely free and open-source software, as opposed to Ubuntu's repositories which are a little more liberal in their licensing requirements. It is the latest addition to this post because of the fact I have just barely had enough experience with it to write a review.

I find it aesthetically unique (afterall it does not use Ubuntu's Unity shell) from Ubuntu, although personally I do not find it anymore appealing than Ubuntu, but from the point of view of the user with regard to everything else it is pretty much identical to the Ubuntu LTS releases it is built on, except it does not have the Ubuntu Software Center, rather it has the Synaptic package manager for graphical package management.

It is presently ranked 95th for popularity according to the *DistroWatch* website.
