body:
  - Variable: "`DEPEND`"
    Meaning:  "List of the package's build dependencies. These dependencies are only required for **building the package**,
    the `RDEPEND` variable provides dependencies that are required to run the program after it is installed."
    Links:    "[Dependencies: devmanual link](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/dependencies/index.html)"
  - Variable: "`DESCRIPTION`"
    Meaning:  "A one-line description of the package. This field is **mandatory**."
    Links:    "None."
  - Variable: "`DOCS`"
    Meaning:  "An array or space-separated list of documentation files to be installed using the `dodoc` function (requires **EAPI&geq;4.**)."
    Links:    "None."
  - Variable: "`EAPI`"
    Meaning:  "Portage API version. Allowed values are integers between 0 and 6. Default value is 0."
    Links:    "[EAPI: devmanual link](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/variables/index.html#eapi)"
  - Variable: "`HOMEPAGE`"
    Meaning:  "The URL of the package's home page. It is mandatory, except for virtual packages."
    Links:    "None."
  - Variable: "`KEYWORDS`"
    Meaning:  "Keywords used to indicate package stability on different architecture types. A tilde (`~`) before an architecture (e.g.,
    `x86`) denotes that while no bugs have been detected on this architecture, but it has not been sufficiently tested for its stability to
    be certain. No tilde before an architecture indicates that its stability has been established by rigorous testing and usage."
    Links:    "[Keywording: devmanual link](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/keywording/index.html)"
  - Variable: "`IUSE`"
    Meaning:  "List of USE flags that are used in the ebuild."
    Links:    "None."
  - Variable: "`LICENSE`"
    Meaning:  "The package's license or licenses, which should exactly correspond (including its case) to a file in `licenses/`."
    Links:    "[LICENSE: devmanual link](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/ebuild-writing/variables/index.html#license)"
  - Variable: "`RDEPEND`"
    Meaning:  "List of the package's runtime dependencies."
    Links:    "[Dependencies: devmanual link](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/dependencies/index.html)"
  - Variable: "`RESTRICT`"
    Meaning:  "This is a space-delimited list of Portage features that should be disabled or restricted. For example,
    <code>RESTRICT=&#34;mirror&#34;</code> forces the ebuild to only download the source code from the `SRC_URI` (or equivalent) and not try the Gentoo mirrors."
    Links:    "[ebuild(5) manpage](/man/ebuild.5.html)"
  - Variable: "`SLOT`"
    Meaning:  "The package's `SLOT`. This is used to install multiple different versions of the same package simultaneously on the same
    system and is **mandatory**."
    Links:    "[Slotting: devmanual](https://devmanual.gentoo.org/general-concepts/slotting/index.html)"
  - Variable: "`SRC_URI`"
    Meaning:  "URL of the source code (usually in archive format like `.tar.gz`). Can be in the form of a list. With **EAPI&geq;2** the output
    file name of a given URI can be customized using the -> operator."
    Links:    "None."
